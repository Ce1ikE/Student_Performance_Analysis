# Student_Performance_Analysis

## repository for the course of Python for AI 🏫


<p>
    Used python 3.10 due to some compatability issues with tensorflow. 
    using docker and creating a docker container for setting the correct versions used for this project is probably easier then craeting a virtual environment with venv
    But if ´you´ wish to try i've added 2 requirements files:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>requirements.txt => used for setting up python virtual environment</li> 
    <li>requirements_docker.txt => used by the dockerfile to build the docker image</li> 
</ol>

## How to run the project ? 🖥️
in any terminal (preferably one that supports ANSI CSI) go to the root of the project
and run with python the `project.py` file
```
$ cd /path/to/repo/Student_Performance_Analysis
$ python3 project.py
```
